# Problem Statement

Welcome to the CoderPad File Tree Challenge!
Today, we are tasked with building a File Tree UI given a list of File objects, consisting of a path and the contents of the file. Your solution must:

- display files in a nested structure, with entries for each folder and file
- be able to handle arbitrarily-deep file structures
- sort the file tree by the following rules:
  - folders are shown before files
  - all items are sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive)
  
If you solve this challenge and we still have more time, our follow-on task is to implement the ability to add new files to the file tree.
